  <!-- Introduction -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="part1-0">1.0 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Robots are intelligent objects and a way to enhance kids' toys. The design of children's toys that can move,
      react and think bring a new realm of possibilities to explore. Robots are a new way to design toys for children
      of different ages, learning difficulties, and needs.
    </p>
    <h3 id="part1-1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this report is to discuss the beneficial effects robotic toys can have. This paper will look at
      designing for an age group and making inclusive toys. Then examine the social, physical, and educational needs
      robots were intended to fill.</p>
    <h3 id="part1-2">1.2 Scope</h3>
    <p>The report will start by laying the groundwork for design elements. Then this report will explain the importance
      of designing for age groups. Next, it will look at the benefits of inclusive design. Finally, it will dive into
      robots designed to increase kids’ social skills, activity levels, and skill development. The research will focus on
      child development and how toys impact it. The paper will limit the research to robotic toys designed to benefit
      children.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- Design Elements -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="part2-0">2.0 Toy Design Elements</h2>
    <p>From a thought to a market-ready product, designers make thousands of choices. A toy is an object that children
      under the age of 14 use to learn or play with (Government of Canada, 2021). Robots are sensors, motors, and circuit
      boards that intelligently react to their environment (Encyclopedia, N.D.). Combining the two produces an object
      capable of moving and responding to a child as they play with or learn from it. The combination creates a toy that
      can react to the child.
    </p>
    <p>By looking at child development specialists, designers can understand what age groups are physically and cognitively
      ready for the type of toy (Toy Industry Association, Inc, 2014). Specifically, the child's age impacts their reaction to
      the toy, as younger kids lack the ability to understand robots.
    </p>
    <p>A toy's design is also heavily influenced by marketability and cost-effectiveness (Toy Industry Association, Inc, 2014).
      Both are significant factors to consider as they are deciding factors for a toy getting on shelves. Robotic toys tend to be
      more expensive, and creating a toy that fills specific niches can help to justify that cost.
    </p>
    <p>Robots have benefitted many problems in child development. Exploring the robotic toys designed to socialize, get kids
      more active, and educate, will demonstrate how. Creating a toy to fill a specific niche leads to unique toy ideas. The
      individuality of a toy is another crucial design element (Toy Industry Association, Inc, 2014). Looking for problems a toy
      can solve increases the chance of an original idea.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Designing for Differences -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="part3-0">3.0 Designing for Differences</h2>
    <p>A significant consideration for toy design comes from demographics. Not all kids are the same. The term kid spans
      many years of growth and learning. Each stage in child development focuses on different aspects of becoming a
      functioning adult.
      Babies and toddlers can lack the understanding required to interact with a robot's complex movements, possibly even
      becoming frightened. In comparison, older kids will be able to navigate the toy with ease.
    </p>
    <p>Kids with disabilities also have different requirements for their toys. Since disabilities can affect children's
      development in many ways, robotic toys can be developed to strengthen these skills. Through inclusive design, toys built for
      one disability can positively affect another. The importance of designing for differences comes from understanding when children
      are different and when inclusion benefits everyone.
    </p>
    <h3 id="part3-1">3.1 Designing for Age Groups</h3>
    <p>Babies to big kids all play with toys, but baby toys and kids' toys look very different. As a child grows, they develop various skills
      and identities. From the moment a child is born to about nine months, they learn to move their muscles. From there, until about three
      years old, the child is refining muscle control and forming an understanding of how the world works (Ben-Joseph, 2018). Children’s primary
      focus and interest revolve around learning to grasp, crawl, walk and run. Their attention is on how things move and why everything is
      happening. While robotic toys for babies and toddlers are not impossible, children of this age have difficulties understanding robots and
      their movements (Fink et al., 2014). A baby's lack of understanding of emotions and patterns creates difficulty in figuring out why and
      how a robot is moving. Furby is an excellent example of a toy with an age limit. Having the ability to change personalities depending on
      how a child treats it, Furby can freak out children. One mom’s story describes how Furby developed a mean personality and left her
      five-year-old daughter crying (Christina, 2015).
    </p>
    <p>At four to six years of age, children learn to use robotic toys. They also develop their imagination and social skills (Ben-Joseph, 2018).
      At this age, their manipulation of robots tends to be limited to if I-push-a-button-the robot does this. As seen with the Furby example,
      having a robot react to the child’s behaviour requires more cognitive understanding. A child's lack of understanding makes build-your-own
      robot kits and learn-to-code toys great ideas for this age group. Parents tend to focus on developing their preschoolers' math and
      linguistic skills, which makes educational toys highly sought after (Parents Editors, 2022).
    </p>
    <p>From six years on, kids start developing their sense of identity and interests (Ben-Joseph, 2018). This age group has many possibilities
      for toys since the child is forming their interests and have the understanding to quickly learn how a robotic toy works. Social robots that
      react based on a child's behaviour are great to introduce at these ages.
    </p>
    <p>The potential for a robotic toy to grow with a child is a unique design feature. When coded intentionally, a robot can sing nursery rhymes
      to a younger child and play games with an older one (Matheson, 2019). Increasing a toy's longevity by providing the correct type of play for
      an age group can expand the usefulness and desire to buy the toy.
    </p>
    <p>Understanding what age group or range of age groups a toy is for can benefit the marketability of the toy. Each age group has different ways,
      advertising reaches them. Defining the demographics of a toy can help ensure it reaches the right little hands and bring the most joy to the user.
    </p>
    <h3 id="part3-2">3.2 Designing for Special Needs</h3>
    <p>As a child grows and develops, they will learn crucial skills which disabilities can impact in various ways. There are five core skills
      a child needs to develop. Motor skills are the child's control over their muscles, separated into gross and fine. Linguistic skills are the
      ability for them to talk and communicate. Cognitive development is their ability to think and understand their environment. Finally,
      socio-emotional skills are a child's ability to read their own and others’ emotions (Symbiosis Institute of Design, 2022). Numerous mental
      and physical conditions can delay these core skills(Symbiosis Institute of Design, 2022).
    </p>
    <p>Examining blindness as an example of a physical condition demonstrates how it affects children’s development. Visually impaired kids can
      struggle with their cognitive, motor and social skills due to a lack of stimulation (Strategic Design Research Journal, 2020). The absence of
      inclusive toys on the market causes this lack of stimulation. An inclusive toy is any toy able to include everyone and is played with similarly
      by children with or without a disability (Strategic Design Research Journal, 2020). In the study of making an inclusive toy, researchers found
      that tactile and auditory stimulation are heavily relied on in blind children. (Strategic Design Research Journal, 2020). This discovery led
      to the design of the toy found in figure 1.
    </p>
    <div class="pictureBox">
      <h4>Figure 1: Toy designed for inclusivity</h4>
      <img class="picture" src="RoboticDesignOfKidsToysImages\image2.png" alt="Toy designed for inclusivity">
      <h4>Note:(Strategic Design Research Journal, 2020)</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The toy is designed to have a variety of textures, including wood, various fabrics, velcro and foam. The different textures stimulate the
      kids’ tactile perception (Strategic Design Research Journal, 2020). The design of this toy can also help develop sighted kids' fine motor skills,
      which have been found to improve by touching different textures (Symbiosis Institute of Design, 2022). In general, a toy similar to Figure 1 can
      improve skills in both blind children and kids with dyspraxia who struggle with their motor skills (Symbiosis Institute of Design, 2022). The
      ability of an inclusive toy is powerful since a feature designed for one disability can positively benefit another. In the design of a robotic toy,
      adding different textures, sounds and ranges of motion will make a more enjoyable toy and benefit children with disabilities.
    </p>

  <!-- Toys that serve a purpose -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="part4-0">4.0 Toys that Serve a Purpose</h2>
    <p>Toys can serve a variety of purposes. While some toys can be just for fun, a robotic toy can fill a niche. Robots have
      provided social interaction and improved mental health. Through social robots, children have developed the socio-emotional
      skills crucial to their development. Implementing a computer brain allows toys to almost come alive and be seen as a thinking
      and feeling entity. Robotic toys also encourage physical activity by creating new ways to play and adding extra encouragement.
      Similarly, robots can teach more advanced skills than the core developmental ones. A child can be encouraged by a robot
      like no other toy. This section will examine a few robots that filled these beneficial roles.
    </p>

    <h3 id="part4-1">4.1 Toys that Develop Social Skills</h3>
    <p>Robotic toys, with their ability to think and respond, have been used in reactive and proactive ways to help kids socialize.
      Having a physical object react like a living creature offers more mental health and social benefits than inanimate objects.
      Specifically, the Huggable robot improved mental health and social interaction more than an inanimate plush toy and a virtual
      app using the same character design (Matheson, 2019). Robots have a unique ability to be perceived as living things, allowing
      them to have social benefits.
    </p>
    <p>Through a robot’s programming and use of sensors, designers can implement life-like behaviours. An example is Shelly the
      Robotic Tortoise, a robot designed to teach kids to treat robots with respect, see figure 2 (Choi, 2018). Shelly is designed
      to light up and dance when children pet the shell gently (Pearson, 2020). The lights, music, and movements encourage kids to
      be gentle with positive reinforcement. Shelly is also designed to turn off the sounds and lights and retract its head, and
      limbs into the shell if hit or petted too hard (Pearson, 2020). This reaction simulates a real tortoise and provides negative
      reinforcement for robot abuse. Sensors on the robot determine how it is being touched. The robot's programming uses this
      information to control the motors and lights to react, encouraging or discouraging selective behaviours in children. The
      reinforcement leads kids to develop their socio-emotional skills without harming creatures or other humans. The movements
      also make the robot feel alive and earn the kids' respect, similar to a living creature (Choi, 2018).
    </p>
    <div class="pictureBox">
      <h4>Figure 2: Shelly the Robotic Tortoise</h4>
      <img class="picture" src="RoboticDesignOfKidsToysImages\image4.png" alt="Toy designed for inclusivity">
      <h4>Note:(Pearson, 2020)</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Robots are also designed to build children’s social skills, especially if they struggle to communicate with friends.
      Moxie is a robot that encourages kids to socialize by offering activities that develop essential life skills. The approach
      taken leads the child to positive social interactions. Moxie focuses on good habits, like taking turns, maintaining eye
      contact, emotional maturity, and being a good listener (Ackerman, 2020). Moxie works by setting goals that develop these
      skills, often including developing friendships with other kids. Moxie is also programmed to set boundaries by getting tired
      if a child tries to achieve too much in one day (Ackerman, 2020). Having a toy to guide a child to develop social skills
      allows them to learn at their own pace. The child learns through experience from an object they treat as a peer. Social
      robots show massive potential as children's toys as they can shape a child's behaviour by simply reacting, allowing the
      child to develop at their own pace.
    </p>
    <h3 id="part4-2">4.2 Toys to Get Children Active</h3>
    <p>A big part of toys is how they get kids active. Basketballs, soccer balls, skipping ropes and more, older kids use a lot
      of active toys. Since the covid pandemic, Canadian kids have become less active, with only 28% getting more than an hour of
      daily physical activity (Global News, 2022). Robotic toys bring new and exciting ways to exercise and help kids become active.
      Hackaball is an excellent example. As seen in Figure 3, the Hackaball is a programmable ball that can survive being tossed,
      hit and dropped (Hackaball, 2016). Allowing kids to program the ball through a mobile app enables them to create games to
      play with friends. By allowing kids to program the toy, Hackaball increases its usability and longevity. Kids can get excited
      to test their own games, and the infinite possibilities for games can keep them active longer. Applying this principle to
      other robotic toys shows how they hold kids’ interest for longer.
    </p>
    <div class="pictureBox">
      <h4>Figure 3: Kids playing with a Hackaball</h4>
      <img class="picture" src="RoboticDesignOfKidsToysImages\image1.png" alt="Toy designed for inclusivity">
      <h4>Note: (Hackaball, 2016)</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Robots can also encourage physical activity in hospital patients. Due to medical conditions and a hospital environment,
      patients and especially young kids, can struggle to stay active. By introducing the Huggable robot, researchers demonstrated
      how more interactive toys resulted in more activity in children (Matheson, 2019). The benefit resulted from a toy with
      interactive activities and games. This feature in many robotic toys encourages children to move more than stationary toys.
    </p>
    <p>Toys can also get kids active in productive ways. Getting a child to put away their toys is a useful task and a common
      problem for parents. Ranger was designed to help parents with this exact problem. Ranger, a robotic toy box, waves whenever
      a toy is placed in his bin. The reactiveness of Ranger allowed kids to proactively clean up their toys by providing positive
      reinforcement (Fink et al., 2014). Ranger’s success leads to the possibility of other chore robots being a way to motivate
      kids. Robotic toys show great potential, from encouraging physical activity to reinforcing positive habits.
    </p>
    <h3 id="part4-3">4.3 Toys to Teach Children</h3>
    <p>Playing with toys and games is a common way for kids to learn. Robotic toys have an educational advantage over inanimate toys
      since they are coded and built. Allowing kids to see the inner workings of a robot gives them hands-on experience in STEM
      activities. Therefore, build-your-own robot kits support children's programming skills and ease the transition into computerized
      coding as they grow up (Metin, 2020). Introducing coding allows kids to build on their computer knowledge at a young age.
    </p>
    <p>Robot kits are one of many types of toys that introduce coding. Other toy designs allow kids to input a series of movements
      to help a robot navigate through obstacles. The Code-A-Pillar by Fisher Price is an example of such a toy. As seen in figure 4,
      kids can add instructions to the toy by attaching body segments to the Code-A-Pillar (Fisher Price, 2016). This form of play
      demonstrates to children how strictly robots follow instructions, starting them on a path to understanding how robots think.
    </p>
    <div class="pictureBox">
      <h4>Figure 4: Code-a-Pillar</h4>
      <img class="picture" src="RoboticDesignOfKidsToysImages\image3.png" alt="Toy designed for inclusivity">
      <h4>Note:(Walmart, N.D.)</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Inputting instructions is only one way to teach a robot. Through artificial intelligence(A.I.), developers can input a result.
      The robot determines how to move based on the desired results, forming its instructions. Using the Ergo Jr, Robot kids can train
      a robot by recording movements. The movements get saved as scratch code, and activating the robot allows the user to play the
      movements back (Stefania, 2017). This procedure can give kids an easy and understandable way to learn about A.I.
    </p>
    <p>Training a robot through movements can also teach kids about their own movements. For example, training a robot to handwrite
      can improve the child’s handwriting (Lemaignan et al., 2016). The study told children that the robot needed help learning to
      handwrite. Kids could move the robot's arms around and have the robot playback what it learnt. This procedure improved the child’s
      handwriting and hand-eye coordination (Lemaignan et al., 2016). As kids trained the robot, they had to think critically about
      the movement, which improved their understanding. Applying the principle to other physical movements shows the benefits robots
      can have on a child’s coordination. Teaching through robots has shown great potential in many areas, from mental skills to physical
      coordination.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="part5-0">5.0 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Robotic toys are designed to solve needs. Robots can be toys that grow with the child or bring one age group the most joy. Adding
      textures and sounds makes a toy inclusive and supports disabilities. Social robots, like Shelly and Moxie, can improve mental health
      and socio-emotional skills. Robotic toys, like the Hack-a-ball, can get kids active. While robots, like Ranger, can make kids
      productive. Learning toys benefit from robotic parts because of their natural ability to teach about STEM and the potential to teach
      by being taught. The impact robotic toys have made shows their future potential making them a great way to solve problems in childhood.</p>
