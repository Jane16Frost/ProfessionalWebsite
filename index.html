      <p class=bodyText>I really enjoy certain things. I definitely enjoy some things more than others!
        My favourite hobby is great, and I also like some foods. Growing up, I was always
        fond of my favourite activities. Plus, I really like some styles of music!
        People that know me would definitely confirm that these facts are true!
        That's really all there is to say.

        I have a lot of hobbies including coding like this shitty looking website. Art which I'm actually good at.
        And a few new things like, parkour, ice skating and annoying my friends.</p>

        When I don't have a current project. I love to play around with concepts and ideas. I started as a
        traditional artist but I’ve grown my skills to be great at digital art, too. I love showing off my art and
        improvement over the years and this Art Gallery is where I’ll show and tell you about some of my specific projects.
