        <p>I really enjoy certain things. I definitely enjoy some things more than others!
          My favourite hobby is great, and I also like some foods. Growing up, I was always
          fond of my favourite activities. Plus, I really like some styles of music!
          People that know me would definitely confirm that these facts are true!
          That's really all there is to say.

          I have a lot of hobbies including coding like this shitty looking website. Art which I'm actually good at.
          And a few new things like, parkour, ice skating and annoying my friends.</p>

          My first website I ever made. It may look simple and that's because it is. I made it using only html. I think it will serve as a good reminder of how far I've come.

        <p class="padded">
          My second website. It looks a lot prettier than the first because it was made with both html and css. It may look nicer but it lacked functionality.

        <!-- Talk about what it could be -->
        <p class="padded">What could be next? This website is pretty and functional unlike the previous two. But there is still so much to learn. So stay tuned to see how far my skills will progress.</p>
