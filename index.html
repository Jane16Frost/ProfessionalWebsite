        <p>I really enjoy certain things. I definitely enjoy some things more than others!
          My favourite hobby is great, and I also like some foods. Growing up, I was always
          fond of my favourite activities. Plus, I really like some styles of music!
          People that know me would definitely confirm that these facts are true!
          That's really all there is to say.

          I have a lot of hobbies including coding like this shitty looking website. Art which I'm actually good at.
          And a few new things like, parkour, ice skating and annoying my friends.</p>

              make incredible pieces each day. All the pieces were completed on time with full color and shading. I
              had so much fun with this challenge and it brought my digital art skills to the next level.

              line and was worked on in the spare time I had each day. I completed all the pieces on time with a messy
              art style and black and white color scheme. It was a difficult challenge but pushed my art and design
              skills to the next level.

              <br>When I don't have a current project. I love to play around with concepts and ideas. I started as a
              traditional artist but I’ve grown my skills to be great at digital art, too. I love showing off my art and
              improvement over the years and this Art Gallery is where I’ll show and tell you all about my individual pieces.
