                        I’m Jay, an aspiring Embedded System Developer. I started coding 6 years ago for a robotics class hosted by my high school. 
                        Seeing the code I wrote on a computer screen translate to a working robot, excited me and kicked off my coding journey. I 
                        continued my journey by learning c++ so I could code my own small video games. While game development was exciting I missed 
                        the building and hardware aspect. So when considering a future career, embedded system development seemed like a natural fit 
                        for me since I love designing, coding and building projects. So I applied to NAIT’s Computer Engineering Technology Program 
                        to learn how to develop embedded systems.
